# Raw-Vegan-Diet_Optimization-Cost

In this repo you will find the dataset from all vegetables, fruits and oilseeds that you can find in Mexico City in great scale. It is importat to take care of our
health and others, even in this hard times the pandemic has begun, one way of doing that is by introducing a new diet that is supported by scientists around the 
World. One of them, well-recognized Dr. Erick Estrada, a researcher from the National University of Mexico, that reached into a conclusion about the nature of the
diet of humannity, which is to be raw-vegetarian. This diet includes fruits, vegetables and oilseeds.

During this project, We are going to analyze data along with their nutrients so we can minimize costs but maximizing nutrients based on weight of the person, their sex, and
the money that they afford to buy. In order to get into the best combination of raw-vegetarian diet components minimizing costs

The data was given to us by Dr. Erik Estrada, that had made a data base for all fruits that are available in Mexico. If you like to contact him, you can do it by visiting his website. https://www.erickestrada.com.mx/

# The Impact of this work
Giving a solution to this kind of problem, opens the door to many practical ways to get the perfect diet without at expenses of the money. Thus, many people around the world are going to benefit from these results that are suffering a loss of a family member that provided economically, or that suffer the loss of their jobs. I find a way that those limited savings maximizes the nutritional content with a limited budget.
